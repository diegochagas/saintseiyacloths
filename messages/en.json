    "0": "Saint Seiya (Japanese: 聖闘士星矢 セイントセイヤ, Hepburn: Seinto Seiya), also known as Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac or simply Knights of the Zodiac (translated from the French title Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque), is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada. It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1985 to 1990, with its chapters collected in 28 tankōbon volumes. In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media.",
    "1": "The story follows five mystical warriors called the Saints who fight wearing sacred sets of armor named 'Cloths', the designs of which derive from the various constellations the characters have adopted as their destined guardian symbols. The Saints have sworn to defend the reincarnation of the Olympian goddess Athena in her battle against other gods who want to dominate Earth.",
    "2": "The manga was adapted by Toei Animation into a 114-episode anime television series broadcast on TV Asahi from 1986 to 1989. The anime series was followed by a 31-episode original video animation (OVA) series, subtitled The Hades Chapter, released from 2002 to 2008. Four animated feature films premiered in Japanese theaters from 1987 to 1989, with a fifth in 2004 and a sixth in 2014. A live-action film adaptation premiered in 2023.",
    "3": "The Saint Seiya manga had over 50 million copies in circulation by 2022, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Both the original manga and the anime adaptation were successful internationally across Asia, Europe, and Latin America.",
    "4": "A manga sequel by Kurumada, titled Saint Seiya: Next Dimension, was serialized from 2006 to 2024. Several spin-off manga by different authors have also been created."

  "newsDescription": {
    "1": "Gemini Abel, a prominent character in Saint Seiya: Next Dimension, served as the younger Gemini Gold Saint during the 18th century, guarding the third temple. A complex and enigmatic figure, Abel is revealed to be the malevolent shadow of his twin brother, Gemini Cain, embodying the darker half of Cain's soul—a duality that has plagued the pair since childhood. Trained at the Sanctuary in Greece, Abel mastered powerful techniques such as Another Dimension, Genro Mao Ken, and Galaxian Explosion, wielding the formidable Gemini Cloth with devastating precision. His decision to oppose Athena underscores the intricate themes of inner conflict and sibling rivalry that define the saga.",
    "2": "The peculiarities of the myth of Apollo may have served as inspiration for Kurumada and the production team to develop Abel and include him in the Greek mythology of Saint Seiya, establishing that in the mythical era (probably during the time when Apollo was exiled on Earth), Abel, one of Zeus's sons, proclaimed himself the Sun God ('Phoebus Abel') and attempted to dominate the Earth. From there, we can assume that at this moment, Apollo rebelled against Abel, since he lived on Earth and, proud of his nature, refused to be dominated like humans. After all, even though he was no longer on Olympus, Apollo was still a powerful god. Zeus, who also disagreed with Abel's ambition, supported Apollo, and together they eliminated Abel, leaving him forgotten in history. Not to mention that the film tells us that not only Zeus and Apollo were angered by Abel, but other gods as well.",
    "3": "This concept is a reimagining created by the artist Márcio Damassena (Cerberus Rack), using Liu-Xing as the character. The armor design is inspired by the Dragon Cloth from the classic Saint Seiya anime. For many years, he has been the ruler of Senkyou. He trained Dohko during his time there and later entrusted him to the care of his master in the Five Old Peaks of Rozan. Years after Dohko's departure, his powers were stolen by Feiyan, who became the ruler. However, before being imprisoned in a statue, he managed to separate a fragment of his power in the form of Liu-Xing. After Dohko defeats Feiyan, Hakuryu is freed and returns to command Senkyou.",
    "4": "One of the Four Heavenly Kings, a First-Class Pallasite, Aegaeon wields the sacred sword called 'Jūbakuraizanba.' He finds humans to be an intriguing form of life that both cause wars and despise conflict. His body is clad in a Chronotector, an armor forged in ancient times. The First-Class Chronotectors correspond to the 12 zodiac constellations, just as Athena's Gold Saints' Cloths correspond to them. Aegaeon's Gravitontector governs the signs of Libra, Scorpio, and Capricorn. His sword was damaged in a past battle with Ikki, sparking a deep fascination with humans within Aegaeon.",
    "5": "Aegir of Phantom Arm is a Secondary Pallasite and a subordinate of Hyperion. He attacks Palaestra with the help of Thebe and an army of Pallasites under his master's command. Aegir's name references one of Saturn's moons, also known as Saturn XXXVI or 2004 S-10, which is inspired by Norse mythology, specifically the giant Ægir, the god of the oceans.",
    "6": "Aeson was once the Silver Saint of the Crater constellation, serving the goddess Athena and the Sanctuary. In the present, however, Aeson appears as a warrior serving the goddess Eris within Eris's Temple, in the chamber leading to her throne. During this time, he reunites with Rigel, an old companion, and expresses his gratitude to Eris for granting him a new life. In Greek mythology, Aeson was a king of Iolcus, the son of Tyro and Cretheus, and the father of Jason. His half-brother Pelias usurped the throne, forcing Jason to live far from the court, hidden in Thessaly and raised by the centaur Chiron. In his old age, Aeson was rejuvenated by the sorceress Medea, Jason's lover.",
    "7": "Aghora of Lotus is a 20th-century Silver Saint and a disciple of Shaka of Virgo, exclusively created for the anime adaptation. The name 'Aghora' refers to the assemblies held outdoors in ancient Greek city-states, where freeborn citizens gathered to discuss important matters such as politics and religion. The most famous of these spaces was the Agora of Athena. The term 'agoraphobia' relates to individuals with an aversion to open spaces, being in public, or exposure to certain public situations. His name may also derive from aghora (अघोर, aghori), a sect of mystics or wandering monks devoted to Shiva who practice post-mortem rituals. In Hindu astronomy, the lotus is associated with Anuradha, the seventeenth lunar asterism (nakshatra), entirely located in the Scorpio constellation. Anuradha is symbolized by a lotus flower. In Buddhism, the lotus represents purity of body and mind, spiritual awakening, and rebirth.",
    "8": "Agrios of Lapis Lazuli (Brute Force) is one of the giants led by Typhon. Ágrios was a giant born from the union of Gaia and Uranus, who fought in the Gigantomachy. Alongside another giant, Thoas, he was ultimately defeated by the Moirai using bronze apples. The name Ágrios (άγριος) translates to Wild or Fierce.",
    "9": "Aiakos of Garuda, Celestial Star of Heroism, is one of the three Judges of the Underworld in Saint Seiya, a series created by Masami Kurumada. The name Aiakos is based on Aeacus, who, in Greek mythology, is one of the judges of the Underworld alongside Minos and Rhadamanthys, just as in the series. In the manga Next Dimension, it is revealed that he is Suikyo of Crater, the former Silver Saint of Crater. In The Lost Canvas series, the true name of the Garuda Specter is also Suikyo, though he is known as Aiakos.",
    "10": "The younger brother of Aiolos, he has an explosive personality but a pure heart, allowing him to quickly distinguish the righteous. This made him one of the first Gold Saints to recognize Athena's authority. Since his brother Aiolos was condemned as a traitor, he strives to restore the family's honor by pledging loyalty to the Grand Pope, even voluntarily participating in the elimination of the Bronze Saints. During the battle against the Specters, he faced the enemy forces head-on, taking down many Specters and serving as the central offensive power in the Sanctuary.",
    "11": "Aiolia of Leo is a 20th-century Gold Saint who is reborn in Asgard after his death at the Wailing Wall. He is the protagonist of Soul of Gold. To awaken the divine armor, it was necessary not only to elevate his cosmos but also to have had a strong connection with Athena. Aiolia recalled that, shortly after the Battle of the Twelve Temples, he received from the goddess Athena the medallion that belonged to his brother. The lion roars, pushing his cosmos to its maximum level. Aiolia successfully awakens his divine armor.",
    "12": "Aiolia donned Odin's Robe with the god's consent, and it turned golden. Along with the Draupnir, it allowed Aiolia to fight on equal terms against the false god Loki. Draupnir is a valuable artifact that holds the power to seal the false god Loki. Even with this hidden power, Draupnir can only be wielded by someone with the potential and who is chosen to do so!",
    "13": "Aiolos of Sagittarius is the 20th-century Gold Saint of Sagittarius. Thirteen years before his death, he entrusted the infant Athena and his Gold Armor to Mitsumasa Kido, who was traveling through Greece. Since then, Aiolos has been considered a traitor in the Sanctuary, which was ruled by Saga disguised as the Grand Pope. Even in death, his soul continues to guide the Sagittarius Armor, always aiding in critical moments—for example, lending it to Seiya during the battle against Poseidon.",
    "14": "Aiolos is resurrected in Asgard and immediately begins investigating the evil surrounding Yggdrasil through someone’s guidance. His investigations lead him to Andreas, the new representative of Asgard. Avoiding any dialogue, Andreas attacks him, but Aiolos easily evades the assault. Realizing the confrontation is inevitable, the Sagittarius Saint dons his armor. Aiolos teams up with Saga of Gemini, delivering a final blow to Andreas/Loki with a combination of Atomic Thunderbolt and Galaxian Explosion. Receiving Athena's support through rose petals stained with her blood, Aiolos burns his cosmos, awakening his divine Sagittarius armor.",
    "15": "Albafica of Pisces is the Gold Saint of Pisces and the protector of the last Zodiac Temple in the 18th century. A disciple of Rugonis of Pisces, he employs variations of attacks using roses, and his blood is extremely poisonous, earning him the title 'Embodied Poison.' During the Holy War, he faces and defeats Minos of Griffon but loses his life in the process.",
    "16": "Alberich of Megrez, Delta Star, is one of the seven God Warriors of Asgard. The name Alberich means 'king of the elves' ('elbe' meaning 'elves,' and 'reix' meaning 'king'). He was also considered the king of dwarves. The French translation of Alberich is Oberon, a character known as the king of fairies in French and English fantasy literature, notably in A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare. Before becoming a God Warrior, Alberich served in Valhalla Palace as a soldier. On one occasion, Hilda expressed her discontent with the young man, criticizing him for using his intelligence for petty desires rather than for the benefit of humanity. Displeased, Alberich remained close to Odin’s Representative and witnessed the moment when Hilda, while praying by the sea, was attacked by Poseidon and possessed by the Nibelung Ring. Choosing to keep this knowledge to himself, Alberich decided to use it for his own gain.",
    "17": "Alberich XIII is an ancestor (six generations prior) of Alberich of Megrez. During his fight against Shiryu, it is revealed that this ancestor once fought against the Old Master and was defeated. According to the Old Master's words, Alberich XIII was a warrior who traveled the world seeking powerful opponents to battle. Like the God Warrior, Alberich XIII used the Nature Unity technique. However, Dohko managed to counter it by merging with nature and defeated Alberich XIII with the Dragon’s Wrath. Alberich XIII also recorded the duty of the God Warriors: to protect Odin’s representative on Earth. However, if the enemy proves too powerful, it becomes necessary to gather the seven Odin Sapphires and summon the Balmung sword. He emphasized that all born into the Alberich family must protect Odin's representative—a duty that must never be forgotten.",
    "18": "Aldebaran is the Gold Saint of Taurus in the 20th century, guarding the Taurus Temple in the Sanctuary. Gifted with extraordinary endurance, even Seiya's Pegasus Meteor Punch couldn't harm his body. The Great Horn, a reference to the horn of a raging bull, is a technique unleashed when locked in combat with an enemy. However, if used from a distance, its power doubles. With a frank and straightforward personality, Aldebaran trusts his instincts without concern for appearances or logic. He fought heroically against Niobe of Deep when the Specters invaded the Sanctuary, meeting a valiant end.",
    "19": "Aldebaran of Taurus is the 20th-century Gold Saint who is reborn in Asgard after his death at the Wailing Wall. He is one of the protagonists of Soul of Gold. After the battle with Poseidon and before the fight against Hades, the Gold Cloths receive the protection of the goddess through her tears. While not as potent as a blood-drenched Cloth, this blessing allows the armors to temporarily achieve divine forms. With everything explained, Aldebaran pushes his cosmos beyond its limits, awakening his Divine Cloth.",
    "20": "Allegre of Black Whale is one of the Black Saints who served Avido of Black Altar during the Holy War of 1743. Allegre is first seen posing as a priest in an Italian church, which is raided by the Gold Saints Manigold of Cancer and Albafica of Pisces. The Saints of Athena encounter the renegade standing, drinking wine, and surrounded by the bodies of his victims.",
    "21": "Algethi of Hercules is one of the last Silver Saints of the 20th century to oppose Seiya of Pegasus and the Bronze Saints during the Sanctuary arc. His name derives from the Arabic 'Rasalgethi,' meaning 'head of the kneeling one.' This is the name of the alpha star in the Hercules constellation (Alpha Herculis). Ptolemy, who named the star, likely avoided explicitly addressing the star's significant content out of respect for the first pillar of Islam, the Shahada, instead leaving the religious undertones implicit in its nomenclature.",
    "22": "Algol of Perseus is a Silver Saint of the 20th century. He is one of those who oppose the Bronze Saints in their mission to protect Athena from the Sanctuary. His name comes from the Arabic رأس الغول (Ra's al-Ghul), meaning 'The Head of the Demon.' It is the name of the beta star in the Perseus constellation, representing Medusa's head. This star is always associated with bad luck and future hardships.",
    "23": "Alice is the Gladiator of the Sacred Sword, Vorpal. She is a traveler through time, worlds, and dimensions, searching for Yoshino Hino, who would become the greatest treasure a champion of the Sacred Sword War could receive. Alice is the English form of Alicia, a feminine given name of Greek origin in its Spanish variant. Derived from the ancient Greek word Αλήθεια (Aletheia), it means 'truth.' She is the only member among the Gladiators not based on a historical or mythological character, as she is inspired by the famous protagonist of Lewis Carroll's books. In the novel Through the Looking-Glass, the protagonist, Alice, reads a poem about a hero who slays a monster called 'Jabberwocky' with a weapon named 'Vorpal.' Each Gladiator has a theme representing a different country. As a character originating from Through the Looking-Glass, Alice represents the country of origin of this book, the United Kingdom.",
    "24": "Mii is the Bronze Saint of the Dolphin constellation during the events of the 20th century. In addition to her duties as Athena's warrior, she also serves as Saori Kido's personal assistant, using her full name, Alicia Mii Benethol, in this role. The name Alicia is a variant of Alice, meaning 'noble,' an apt choice reflecting Mii's refined character and her role as Saori Kido's secretary. Considering Mii's blonde hair and association with the color blue, her name may also be a reference to the titular character of Alice in Wonderland, famously depicted with such traits. Chimaki Kuori reinforced this possibility in an image shared on her Twitter, where the Saintias celebrate Halloween, with Mii dressed as the iconic character.",
    "25": "Almaaz de Auriga es un Caballero de Plata del siglo XXI y uno de los guerreros subordinados a Marte. Su nombre hace referencia a la estrella Épsilon de la constelación de Auriga, Almaaz, derivada del árabe Almaz (اَلْمَاعَزْ), que significa 'cabra' en portugués. Esto corresponde a la estrella Alfa Capella, cuyo nombre equivale a 'cabra' en latín.",
    "26": "Alone is one of the main characters in The Lost Canvas, a series by Masami Kurumada and Shiori Teshirogi. The name Alone means 'solitary' or 'alone' in English, reflecting his life as an orphan and the emotional isolation he experienced. Upon becoming the vessel of Hades, he lost many of his human feelings, including his innate kindness.",
    "27": "Amor of Pisces was the Gold Saint of the Pisces constellation in the new Sanctuary ruled by Mars during the final Holy War between the God of War and Athena in the 21st century. He was one of the few who truly knew that Medea, his sister, was the mastermind behind orchestrating the entire war. Ironically, when Amor discovered that he was also being used by his sister to awaken the god Apsu, he was immediately killed by Apsu's vessel.",
    "28": "Loki was a god imprisoned in an amphora and later freed by Andreas. Loki eventually took over Asgard by possessing Andreas. Using his divine power, he possessed Lifya to revive the Gold Saints and feed the seed of evil from Yggdrasil, a tree built with his energy, to bring ruin to Asgard. To deceive the Asgardians and Odin's God Warriors, he used the good reputation of the leader Andreas, claiming that the tree was beneficial to the region, and blamed the difficulties faced by the people in Asgard's cold lands on various other gods.",
    "94": "Curly is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, a feature he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. As with his two companions, his Surplice is an amalgam of several others: Griffin's Helm, Balron Shoulders, Sphinx Wings, Harpy's Arms Deep Breastplate, and Basilisk Legs",
    "165": "Gerald is inspired by a preliminary drawing by Gordon of Minotaur that appears briefly in chapter 83 of the classic manga. Italian cartoonist Marco Albiero recycled this prototype to create Rubicante Gerald, whose Surplice represents a demon of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Later the Online game made the idea of Albiero official and attributed the Captive Earth Star to the Spectrum, as a possible allusion to Gordon. The game does not mention the creature represented by its Surplice, so it is not known if it is the one chosen by Albiero. Gerald shares his Star with Raybold of Saint Seiya's Upir: The Lost Canvas. This is the only case so far when Spectra with different Overlives belonging to different works represent the same Evil Star.",
    "172": "This curiosity refers to the first book of the game Saint Seiya Ougon Densetsu, released on August 31, 1987. In the final part of the book there are two pages (93 and 94) dedicated to the Shadow Cloth (Shadow Armor), a character created just for the first game in the series for the Nintendo 8 bit. Most interesting of all is that the character was created through a promotion by Shueisha in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine and the winner was the Japanese fan Toshiya Ono.",
    "273": "Larry is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, a feature he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. As with your companions, your Surplice is an amalgam of several others: Cyclops Helm and Arms, Balron Shoulderpads, the right of which contains an appendix with two large spines; a part that is not compatible with any other existing Surplice, Wyvern Breastplat and Garuda's Legs",
    "320": "Moe is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, an attribute he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. His surplice is an amalgam of several others: Garuda's Helm, Cyclops Shoulderpads and Breastplate, Balron Wings, Thanatos Arms and Wyvern Legs.",
    "537": "His name and Surplice are references to the villain Kefka Palazzo from the game Final Fantasy VI, who in turn received his name in honor of writer Franz Kafka, known for his surreal and humorous black works. Importantly, the name and the Spectrum Surplice were attributed to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, and are not mentioned in the Chinese original or in the Taizen Encyclopedia; both identify him only by their Evil Star.",
    "628": "Tornado: the elemental warrior was revived by Hades in order to take Athena's head, this warrior overcame the control of the underworld emperor and walked his own path in this new era. Under the tutelage of Shion of Aries, he included a cloth and combined his mysterious elemental powers with the cosmos, becoming a faithful saint of Athena. Today, he dedicates his life to passing on his knowledge to the younger saints so that he can protect the goddess Athena and peace on earth.",
    "680": "Frey is a character who exists only in the movie Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of the Gods. After the creation of the Asgard saga for anime, he and other characters were removed from continuity. This character resembles Alexei, one of the Blue Warriors, especially in appearance, and Frey's relationship with Freya inspired Natassia, Alexei's sister. Because of this, they were gather in this api."
