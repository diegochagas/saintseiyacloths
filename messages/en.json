    "0": "Saint Seiya (Japanese: 聖闘士星矢 セイントセイヤ, Hepburn: Seinto Seiya), also known as Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac or simply Knights of the Zodiac (translated from the French title Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque), is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada. It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1985 to 1990, with its chapters collected in 28 tankōbon volumes. In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media.",
    "1": "The story follows five mystical warriors called the Saints who fight wearing sacred sets of armor named 'Cloths', the designs of which derive from the various constellations the characters have adopted as their destined guardian symbols. The Saints have sworn to defend the reincarnation of the Olympian goddess Athena in her battle against other gods who want to dominate Earth.",
    "2": "The manga was adapted by Toei Animation into a 114-episode anime television series broadcast on TV Asahi from 1986 to 1989. The anime series was followed by a 31-episode original video animation (OVA) series, subtitled The Hades Chapter, released from 2002 to 2008. Four animated feature films premiered in Japanese theaters from 1987 to 1989, with a fifth in 2004 and a sixth in 2014. A live-action film adaptation premiered in 2023.",
    "3": "The Saint Seiya manga had over 50 million copies in circulation by 2022, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Both the original manga and the anime adaptation were successful internationally across Asia, Europe, and Latin America.",
    "4": "A manga sequel by Kurumada, titled Saint Seiya: Next Dimension, was serialized from 2006 to 2024. Several spin-off manga by different authors have also been created."

    "94":	"Curly is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, a feature he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. As with his two companions, his Surplice is an amalgam of several others: Griffin's Helm, Balron Shoulders, Sphinx Wings, Harpy's Arms Deep Breastplate, and Basilisk Legs",
    "165": "Gerald is inspired by a preliminary drawing by Gordon of Minotaur that appears briefly in chapter 83 of the classic manga. Italian cartoonist Marco Albiero recycled this prototype to create Rubicante Gerald, whose Surplice represents a demon of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Later the Online game made the idea of Albiero official and attributed the Captive Earth Star to the Spectrum, as a possible allusion to Gordon. The game does not mention the creature represented by its Surplice, so it is not known if it is the one chosen by Albiero. Gerald shares his Star with Raybold of Saint Seiya's Upir: The Lost Canvas. This is the only case so far when Spectra with different Overlives belonging to different works represent the same Evil Star.",
    "172": "This curiosity refers to the first book of the game Saint Seiya Ougon Densetsu, released on August 31, 1987. In the final part of the book there are two pages (93 and 94) dedicated to the Shadow Cloth (Shadow Armor), a character created just for the first game in the series for the Nintendo 8 bit. Most interesting of all is that the character was created through a promotion by Shueisha in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine and the winner was the Japanese fan Toshiya Ono.",
    "273": "Larry is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, a feature he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. As with your companions, your Surplice is an amalgam of several others: Cyclops Helm and Arms, Balron Shoulderpads, the right of which contains an appendix with two large spines; a part that is not compatible with any other existing Surplice, Wyvern Breastplat and Garuda's Legs",
    "320": "Moe is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, an attribute he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. His surplice is an amalgam of several others: Garuda's Helm, Cyclops Shoulderpads and Breastplate, Balron Wings, Thanatos Arms and Wyvern Legs.",
    "537": "His name and Surplice are references to the villain Kefka Palazzo from the game Final Fantasy VI, who in turn received his name in honor of writer Franz Kafka, known for his surreal and humorous black works. Importantly, the name and the Spectrum Surplice were attributed to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, and are not mentioned in the Chinese original or in the Taizen Encyclopedia; both identify him only by their Evil Star.",
    "628": "Tornado: the elemental warrior was revived by Hades in order to take Athena's head, this warrior overcame the control of the underworld emperor and walked his own path in this new era. Under the tutelage of Shion of Aries, he included a cloth and combined his mysterious elemental powers with the cosmos, becoming a faithful saint of Athena. Today, he dedicates his life to passing on his knowledge to the younger saints so that he can protect the goddess Athena and peace on earth.",
    "680": "Frey is a character who exists only in the movie Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of the Gods. After the creation of the Asgard saga for anime, he and other characters were removed from continuity. This character resembles Alexei, one of the Blue Warriors, especially in appearance, and Frey's relationship with Freya inspired Natassia, Alexei's sister. Because of this, they were gather in this api."
