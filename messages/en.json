    "0": "Saint Seiya (Japanese: 聖闘士星矢 セイントセイヤ, Hepburn: Seinto Seiya), also known as Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac or simply Knights of the Zodiac (translated from the French title Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque), is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada. It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1985 to 1990, with its chapters collected in 28 tankōbon volumes. In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media.",
    "1": "The story follows five mystical warriors called the Saints who fight wearing sacred sets of armor named 'Cloths', the designs of which derive from the various constellations the characters have adopted as their destined guardian symbols. The Saints have sworn to defend the reincarnation of the Olympian goddess Athena in her battle against other gods who want to dominate Earth.",
    "2": "The manga was adapted by Toei Animation into a 114-episode anime television series broadcast on TV Asahi from 1986 to 1989. The anime series was followed by a 31-episode original video animation (OVA) series, subtitled The Hades Chapter, released from 2002 to 2008. Four animated feature films premiered in Japanese theaters from 1987 to 1989, with a fifth in 2004 and a sixth in 2014. A live-action film adaptation premiered in 2023."

    "94": "Curly is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, a feature he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. As with his two companions, his Surplice is an amalgam of several others: Griffin's Helm, Balron Shoulders, Sphinx Wings, Harpy's Arms Deep Breastplate, and Basilisk Legs",
    "165": "Gerald is inspired by a preliminary drawing by Gordon of Minotaur that appears briefly in chapter 83 of the classic manga. Italian cartoonist Marco Albiero recycled this prototype to create Rubicante Gerald, whose Surplice represents a demon of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Later the Online game made the idea of Albiero official and attributed the Captive Earth Star to the Spectrum, as a possible allusion to Gordon. The game does not mention the creature represented by its Surplice, so it is not known if it is the one chosen by Albiero. Gerald shares his Star with Raybold of Saint Seiya's Upir: The Lost Canvas. This is the only case so far when Spectra with different Overlives belonging to different works represent the same Evil Star.",
    "172": "This curiosity refers to the first book of the game Saint Seiya Ougon Densetsu, released on August 31, 1987. In the final part of the book there are two pages (93 and 94) dedicated to the Shadow Cloth (Shadow Armor), a character created just for the first game in the series for the Nintendo 8 bit. Most interesting of all is that the character was created through a promotion by Shueisha in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine and the winner was the Japanese fan Toshiya Ono.",
    "269": "Lamech is the god of nothingness. His goal is to consume everything until he erases all existence from the universe. Like the other gods, he is in a constant war against Athena. Lamech appears in the weekly event Red Mist as a giant flying boss.\nLamech is a biblical name, not a Greek mythological one. He appears in the Book of Genesis, in the Old Testament, as two distinct figures: Lamech, a descendant of Cain (Genesis 4:18–24), a violent man known for saying, 'I have killed a man for wounding me.' Many interpretations associate him with wrath, vengeance, and the moral decay of humanity before the Flood—symbolically, he represents the excess of human violence. And Lamech, the father of Noah (Genesis 5:25–31), a more neutral figure who announces the end of a corrupt era with the birth of Noah, humanity’s redeemer.\nThe idea of a 'God of Nothingness,' seeking to consume all existence, is more cosmological and philosophical than mythological. The writers of Saint Seiya Online likely drew inspiration from concepts such as the primordial Chaos of Greek mythology—the absolute void before creation, the original 'Nothing'—and from the idea of cosmic entropy or the void, the destruction of all form and return to nothingness. Thus, Lamech seems to be a symbolic fusion of a biblical name + the concept of 'destructive void' + the aesthetics of cosmic deities.",
    "273": "Larry is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, a feature he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. As with your companions, your Surplice is an amalgam of several others: Cyclops Helm and Arms, Balron Shoulderpads, the right of which contains an appendix with two large spines; a part that is not compatible with any other existing Surplice, Wyvern Breastplat and Garuda's Legs",
    "320": "Moe is named after one of the members of the comedy group The Three Stooges, an attribute he shares with the other two Dark Stars. This name was given to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, while in the Chinese original he is identified only by his Evil Star. His surplice is an amalgam of several others: Garuda's Helm, Cyclops Shoulderpads and Breastplate, Balron Wings, Thanatos Arms and Wyvern Legs.",
    "451": "Sillas is Lamech’s most faithful servant, carrying out his orders and desires. His main mission is to defeat Athena’s Saints in fair combat; therefore, like his enemies, he wears a Sacred Armor. Sillas appears on certain maps in the game as a field boss and also in the weekly event Red Mist as a giant flying boss.\nThe name Sillas (or Silas, a possible transliteration) does not appear in any classical mythology. However, there are some hypotheses about the symbolic meaning of his name and role: Biblical reference — Silas was a companion of Paul during his missionary journeys (Acts of the Apostles), known for being faithful, obedient, and spiritual — fitting the role of a 'loyal servant.' Linguistic origin — Sillas may derive from Silvanus (Latin), the Roman god of the forests, or from Silenus, the wise satyr who accompanied Dionysus. Both represent servants of greater deities, characterized by devotion and strength.\nIn the context of Saint Seiya Online, Sillas seems to be a kind of Knight loyal to the god of nothingness, reflecting the typical structure of Saint Seiya.",
    "537": "His name and Surplice are references to the villain Kefka Palazzo from the game Final Fantasy VI, who in turn received his name in honor of writer Franz Kafka, known for his surreal and humorous black works. Importantly, the name and the Spectrum Surplice were attributed to him by the Brazilian version of Saint Seiya Online, and are not mentioned in the Chinese original or in the Taizen Encyclopedia; both identify him only by their Evil Star.",
    "628": "Tornado is the elemental warrior revived by Hades in order to take Athena's head, this warrior overcame the control of the underworld emperor and walked his own path in this new era. Under the tutelage of Shion of Aries, he included a cloth and combined his mysterious elemental powers with the cosmos, becoming a faithful saint of Athena. Today, he dedicates his life to passing on his knowledge to the younger saints so that he can protect the goddess Athena and peace on earth.",
    "680": "Frey is a character who exists only in the movie Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of the Gods. After the creation of the Asgard saga for anime, he and other characters were removed from continuity. This character resembles Alexei, one of the Blue Warriors, especially in appearance, and Frey's relationship with Freya inspired Natassia, Alexei's sister. Because of this, they were gather in this api."
