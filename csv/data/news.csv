165,Origin of the name,Wed Nov 27 2024 16:01:27 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time),"Gerald is inspired by a preliminary drawing by Gordon of Minotaur that appears briefly in chapter 83 of the classic manga. Italian cartoonist Marco Albiero recycled this prototype to create Rubicante Gerald, whose Surplice represents a demon of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Later the Online game made the idea of Albiero official and attributed the Captive Earth Star to the Spectrum, as a possible allusion to Gordon. The game does not mention the creature represented by its Surplice, so it is not known if it is the one chosen by Albiero. Gerald shares his Star with Raybold of Saint Seiya's Upir: The Lost Canvas. This is the only case so far when Spectra with different Overlives belonging to different works represent the same Evil Star."
